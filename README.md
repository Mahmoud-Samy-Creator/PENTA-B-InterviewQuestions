# Penata-p interview question 2025
A problem solving interview question as a programming assestment for interview acceptance

# Mars Rover 
## Problem Description 
```
You are part of the team that explores Mars by sending remotely controlled vehicles to the surface of 
the planet. Develop an API that translates the commands sent from earth to instructions that are 
understood by the rover. 
When the rover touches down on Mars, it is initialised with itâ€™s current coordinates and the direction  
it is facing. These could be any coordinates, supplied as arguments (x, y, direction) e.g. (4, 
2, EAST). 
```
## Approach
You should tackle this problem as you would any real world requirement that would be shipped as 
part of a real product. You should showcase how you work and the way you decompose a problem 
into smaller pieces.

## Parts
This problem has 3 parts, 1st one is mandatory, the 2nd and 3rd parts are optional.

### Docs
Each part has it's own docs and unit testings
